# Jax Examples
Jax, Flax, examples (ImageClassification, SemanticSegmentation, and more...)

# About

I started to learn JAX, Flax, Optax, etc ...  
I will be adding mainly computer vision tasks. I will start with code for model learning, inference, and export to other frameworks (such as TensorFlow).
